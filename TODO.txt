# Right now

o Delete the funkiness introduced for lookahead buffers.  Turns out it is wasn't necessary.
o Look at how to make static string regexps even more efficient at pruning based on first char.
o Consider making a notebook to track progress over time instead of the wretched shellscripts currently there.
o At the very least, fix those scripts.
o Introduce more tests that stresses the scale more.  The "unfair comparison" may be a little too unfair.
o Refactor a bunch of code to be more java-20 compliant.  Do use chat-gpt for that.

# Some time in the future

o Do everything in http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-central-repository-upload.html 
  that is necessary to get released through maven central, then decide that it isn't worth it
  and instead set up a microrepo at github, at least for now.
o Or perhaps use sonatype's stuff. https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-1a.TermsofServiceRepository%3ACentralRepositoryTermsofServiceforSubmitters
o Tag a release.
o Write a minimal set of documentation for that release.

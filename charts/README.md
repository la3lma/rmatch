# Performance Charts

This directory contains automatically generated performance evolution charts.

## Files

### Historical Performance Charts (from CSV data)
- `performance_evolution.png` - Comprehensive performance evolution chart with multiple metrics from historical CSV data
- `performance_trend.png` - Simplified chart suitable for README inclusion showing historical trends
- `simple_performance_evolution.png` - Chart generated from simple time-series CSV data

### Recent Performance Test Charts (from JSON data)
- `performance_check_evolution.png` - Detailed evolution of recent performance test results including:
  - Execution time comparison (rmatch vs Java regex)
  - Memory usage comparison
  - Performance improvement percentages over time
  - Test status (PASS/WARNING/FAIL) evolution
- `performance_check_overview.png` - Simplified overview of recent performance test results for documentation

### Combined Charts
- `performance_summary.png` - Combined view showing both historical and recent performance data

## Generation

These charts are automatically generated by:

1. The `scripts/generate_performance_charts.py` script
2. GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/update-performance-charts.yml`
3. Data sourced from multiple sources:
   - CSV files in `rmatch-tester/logs/` (historical data)
   - JSON files in `benchmarks/results/` (recent performance test reports)

**Note**: These files are auto-generated and should not be manually edited.

## Data Sources

The charts are generated from multiple performance data sources:

### Historical Data (CSV format)
- `rmatch-tester/logs/large-corpus-log.csv` - Comprehensive comparison data (rmatch vs Java regex)
- `rmatch-tester/logs/logfile-*.csv` - Individual test run data

### Recent Performance Tests (JSON format)
- `benchmarks/results/performance-check-*.json` - Modern performance test reports generated by GitHubActionPerformanceTestRunner

The comprehensive historical data includes:
- Execution time comparison between rmatch and Java regex
- Memory usage comparison
- Performance ratio over time
- Test scale evolution (number of regexps, corpus size)

The recent performance test data includes:
- Detailed execution metrics for both rmatch and Java regex
- Performance improvement percentages
- Statistical significance indicators
- Test status and quality metrics

# Software (MDPI) Article Draft

This directory contains a draft article prepared for submission to the Software (MDPI) journal.

## Files

- `software-mdpi-article.tex` - Main LaTeX document with margin notes for MDPI-specific adaptations
- `references.bib` - Bibliography file with academic references
- `Makefile` - Build system for generating the PDF
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Building the Article

To build the PDF from the LaTeX source:

```bash
make
```

This will:
1. Run `pdflatex` to compile the document
2. Run `bibtex` to process the bibliography
3. Run `pdflatex` twice more to resolve all references and citations
4. Generate `software-mdpi-article.pdf`

## Cleaning Up

To remove intermediate LaTeX files (but keep the PDF):

```bash
make clean
```

To remove all generated files including the PDF:

```bash
make clean-all
```

## Article Structure

The article follows a structure suitable for the Software (MDPI) journal:

1. **Abstract** - Emphasizing software engineering aspects
2. **Introduction** - Context for modern software systems
3. **Related Work and Software Ecosystem** - Positioning within existing tools
4. **System Design and Architecture** - Software engineering principles
5. **Implementation Challenges and Solutions** - Practical concerns
6. **Performance Analysis** - Real-world deployment scenarios
7. **Software Engineering Considerations** - API design and testing
8. **Conclusion** - Implications for software practice
9. **Future Work** - Research directions

## MDPI Adaptation Notes

The document includes margin notes (using `\mdpinote{}` commands) that suggest adaptations for the Software (MDPI) journal, including:

- Emphasizing software engineering aspects over pure algorithmic details
- Focusing on practical implementation concerns
- Discussing integration with modern software architectures
- Highlighting testing, quality assurance, and maintainability
- Considering deployment scenarios and enterprise applications

## Prerequisites

Building the document requires:
- LaTeX distribution (TeX Live recommended)
- pdflatex
- bibtex
- Standard LaTeX packages: inputenc, babel, amsmath, amsfonts, amssymb, graphicx, cite, url, hyperref, geometry

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended
```

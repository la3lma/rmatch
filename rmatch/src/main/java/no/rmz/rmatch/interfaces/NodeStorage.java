/**
 * Implements a "subset construction mechanism". When matching a regular
 * expression, the expression is first compiled into a nondeterministic finite
 * automaton. That automaton is then opportunistically (incrementally, whatever)
 * compiled into a deterministic finite automaton. Now, the number of
 * determinstic nodes is O(2^N) where N is the number of nondeterminstic nodes,
 * so making them all is, for large regular expressions, usually not an option.
 * That is why we are opportunistic and cacheing etc.
 *
 * The NodeStorage is the interface used to abstract this mechanism away.

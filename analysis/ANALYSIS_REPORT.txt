                rmatch PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE REPORT
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE:
• Performance: ~10% of Java's standard regex matcher
• Algorithm: Thompson NFA + Subset Construction  
• Critical Issue: O(m×l) complexity bottleneck identified

CRITICAL BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS:
• Location: MatchSetImpl constructor (lines 110-130)
• Problem: Creates Match objects for ALL patterns at EVERY position
• Impact: 1000 patterns × 1MB text = 1 billion unnecessary objects
• Code Comment: "most egregious bug in the whole regexp package"

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:

Phase 1 - Fix Critical Issues (Expected 3-5x improvement):
  ✓ First-character optimization: O(m×l) → O(n×k) where k << m
  ✓ Replace synchronized collections with lock-free alternatives
  ✓ Implement object pooling for Match instances
  ✓ Remove string-based counter overhead
  
Phase 2 - Modern Algorithms (Expected 2-3x improvement):  
  ✓ Aho-Corasick integration for literal patterns
  ✓ Bit-parallel NFA simulation for simple patterns
  ✓ Shared prefix/suffix optimization
  
Phase 3 - Hardware Optimization (Expected 2-4x improvement):
  ✓ SIMD vectorization using Java Vector API
  ✓ Advanced DFA state minimization  
  ✓ CPU cache optimization

LITERATURE RESEARCH:
• Aho-Corasick (1975): O(n+m+z) multi-pattern matching
• Myers (1999): Bit-parallel regex techniques  
• Cox (2007): RE2 optimization strategies
• Intel Hyperscan (2016): SIMD-based pattern matching

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
• Conservative Estimate: 12-20x performance improvement
• Optimistic Estimate: 30-60x performance improvement
• Result: rmatch could become 1.5-5x faster than Java's regex

IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:
• Phase 1: 2-3 weeks  
• Phase 2: 3-4 weeks
• Phase 3: 4-6 weeks
• Total: 9-13 weeks for complete optimization

VALIDATION STRATEGY:
• Benchmark against Java regex, RE2, PCRE, Hyperscan
• Test with literal patterns, simple regex, complex regex
• Measure throughput, latency, memory usage, CPU utilization

CONCLUSION:
The analysis identifies clear optimization opportunities that could transform
rmatch from a 10% performance library into the fastest Java regex engine 
available, through systematic application of modern algorithms and optimization
techniques.

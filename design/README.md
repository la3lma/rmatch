# Global Data Access System - Product Requirements Document

This directory contains the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a revolutionary Global Data Access System built on rmatch's high-performance pattern matching capabilities.

## Overview

The Global Data Access System (GDAS) is a comprehensive PRD for a system that can efficiently access, search, and process data from distributed sources worldwide while maintaining exceptional performance, security, and scalability.

## Contents

- `global-data-access-system-prd.tex` - Main LaTeX document containing the complete PRD
- `references.bib` - Bibliography with academic and industry references
- `Makefile` - Build system for compiling the LaTeX document
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Building the Document

### Prerequisites

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-science texlive-bibtex-extra
```

On macOS:
```bash
brew install --cask mactex-no-gui
```

### Compilation

To build the complete PDF with bibliography:
```bash
make all
```

For quick builds during development:
```bash
make fast
```

To clean build artifacts:
```bash
make clean
```

### Available Targets

- `make all` - Full build with bibliography processing
- `make fast` - Quick build without bibliography
- `make clean` - Remove build artifacts
- `make distclean` - Remove all generated files
- `make view` - Open the generated PDF
- `make watch` - Monitor files and rebuild on changes
- `make wordcount` - Count words in the document
- `make info` - Display build information

## Document Structure

The PRD follows a comprehensive structure covering:

1. **Executive Summary** - Vision, success metrics, and key objectives
2. **Problem Statement** - Current state analysis and market opportunity
3. **Requirements** - Functional and non-functional requirements
4. **Technical Architecture** - High-level system design and components
5. **Performance Considerations** - rmatch integration and optimization strategies
6. **Security and Privacy Framework** - Compliance and protection mechanisms
7. **Implementation Roadmap** - Three-phase development plan
8. **Risk Analysis** - Technical and business risk assessment
9. **Success Metrics** - Performance and business KPIs
10. **Appendix** - Rich implementation hints and technical details

## Key Features Covered

### Core Capabilities
- Universal data source integration (50+ types)
- High-performance pattern matching using rmatch
- Unified query interface with multiple APIs
- Intelligent caching and indexing
- Comprehensive security framework

### Performance Requirements
- < 100ms response time for 95% of queries
- > 1M concurrent pattern matches per second
- < 4GB memory usage per query node
- 99.99% availability across global regions

### Implementation Highlights
- Detailed rmatch integration patterns
- Memory-efficient state management
- Distributed query processing
- Reactive streams integration
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

## Technical Implementation Appendix

The appendix provides extensive implementation guidance including:

- **rmatch Integration Patterns** - Efficient pattern compilation and optimization
- **Memory Management** - Off-heap storage and cache-friendly data structures
- **Distributed Processing** - Query sharding and result aggregation
- **Performance Optimization** - JIT compilation and CPU cache optimization
- **Security Implementation** - Query sanitization and encryption
- **Testing Strategies** - JMH benchmarks and chaos engineering

## Architecture Philosophy

The system design follows rmatch project principles:
- **Performance First** - Optimized for throughput and predictable latency
- **Memory Efficiency** - Low allocation and compact data structures
- **Automata-Based** - Deterministic pattern matching without backtracking
- **Thread Safety** - Concurrent access with minimal contention
- **Scalability** - Linear scaling across distributed nodes

## Quality Assurance

The document includes:
- Comprehensive reference bibliography (40+ sources)
- Detailed code examples in Java
- Architecture diagrams using TikZ
- Performance benchmarking guidelines
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Future Enhancements

The PRD establishes a foundation for:
- AI-driven query optimization
- Machine learning-powered caching
- Advanced analytics and monitoring
- Self-optimizing system capabilities

## Getting Started

1. Install LaTeX dependencies
2. Run `make check-tools` to verify installation
3. Execute `make all` to build the complete document
4. Open `global-data-access-system-prd.pdf` to review

For development iterations, use `make watch` to automatically rebuild the document when files change.

## Contributing

When making changes to the document:
1. Maintain the academic rigor and technical depth
2. Follow LaTeX best practices for formatting
3. Update the bibliography when adding new references
4. Test compilation with both `make fast` and `make all`
5. Ensure all code examples are syntactically correct

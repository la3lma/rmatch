# TODO
#  o Plot title and legend for left axis (megabytes)
#  o Add second plot for time in millis with legend on right edge.
#  o Automate the generation of the plots so that the build process can generate them
#    during ordinary builds, using pdf (preferably) to be included in LaTeX.
# something like this http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo/multiaxis.html

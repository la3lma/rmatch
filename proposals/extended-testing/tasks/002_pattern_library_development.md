# Task 002: Pattern Library Development

## Title
Develop Comprehensive Test Pattern Library

## Problem
Current tests use limited pattern sets that don't represent the diversity of real-world regex usage. The existing patterns primarily focus on simple word matching from literary text, which doesn't adequately stress-test the regex engine across different complexity dimensions.

Current pattern limitations:
- Only simple literal patterns from Wuthering Heights corpus
- No systematic categorization by complexity
- Missing pathological cases that could cause performance issues
- No metadata about pattern characteristics
- Limited coverage of regex feature space

## Proposal
Create a structured pattern library with comprehensive coverage of regex complexity:

### Pattern Categories

1. **Simple Literal Patterns (100+ patterns)**
   - Basic string matching: `"hello"`, `"world"`
   - Case variations: `"Hello"`, `"HELLO"`
   - Simple concatenation: `"hello world"`

2. **Character Class Patterns (150+ patterns)**
   - Basic classes: `[a-z]`, `[0-9]`, `[\w]`
   - Negated classes: `[^a-z]`, `[^\d]`
   - Unicode classes: `[\p{L}]`, `[\p{N}]`
   - Custom classes: `[aeiou]`, `[!@#$%]`

3. **Basic Quantifier Patterns (200+ patterns)**
   - `*` (zero or more): `a*`, `[0-9]*`
   - `+` (one or more): `a+`, `\d+`
   - `?` (zero or one): `a?`, `colou?r`
   - `{n,m}` (counted): `a{2,5}`, `\d{3,}`

4. **Complex Quantifier Patterns (80+ patterns)**
   - Nested quantifiers: `(a+)+`, `(a*)*`
   - Mixed quantifiers: `a+b*c?`
   - Large counts: `a{100,200}`, `\d{50,}`

5. **Alternation Patterns (50+ patterns)**
   - Simple alternation: `cat|dog`, `red|green|blue`
   - Nested alternation: `(cat|dog)|(red|blue)`
   - Complex alternation: `(foo|bar)(baz|qux)`

6. **Pathological Patterns (20+ patterns)**
   - Exponential backtracking: `(a+)+b`
   - Catastrophic cases: `(a|a)*b`
   - Deep nesting: `((((a))))`
   - Large alternations: `(word1|word2|...|word1000)`

### Pattern Metadata System
```java
public class PatternMetadata {
    private final PatternCategory category;
    private final int complexityScore;  // 1-10 scale
    private final Set<RegexFeature> features;
    private final String description;
    private final boolean isPotentiallyProblematic;
    
    // Expected performance characteristics
    private final TimeComplexity timeComplexity;
    private final SpaceComplexity spaceComplexity;
}

public enum PatternCategory {
    SIMPLE_LITERAL(1),
    CHARACTER_CLASS(2),
    BASIC_QUANTIFIER(3),
    COMPLEX_QUANTIFIER(5),
    ALTERNATION(4),
    PATHOLOGICAL(10);
}
```

### Pattern Generation System
```java
public interface PatternGenerator {
    List<TestPattern> generatePatterns(PatternCategory category, int count);
    TestPattern generateRandomPattern(PatternGenerationConfig config);
    List<TestPattern> generateStressTestPatterns();
}

public class RegexFeatureBasedGenerator implements PatternGenerator {
    // Generates patterns systematically covering regex feature combinations
}
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Manual Curation (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Curate high-quality patterns from regex literature
   - Include known problematic patterns from security research
   - Add patterns covering Unicode edge cases

2. **Automated Generation (Weeks 3-4)**
   - Implement algorithmic pattern generation
   - Create feature combination matrices
   - Generate stress test patterns programmatically

3. **Validation System (Week 5)**
   - Implement pattern correctness validation
   - Add performance characteristic prediction
   - Create pattern effectiveness scoring

4. **Integration (Week 6)**
   - Integrate with existing test framework
   - Add pattern library management tools
   - Create pattern selection algorithms

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Manual Curation Only
- **Pros**: High-quality, well-understood patterns
- **Cons**: Labor-intensive, limited coverage
- **Effort**: 4-6 weeks

### Alternative 2: Automated Generation Only
- **Pros**: Scalable, broad coverage
- **Cons**: May generate unrealistic patterns, quality control issues
- **Effort**: 6-8 weeks

### Alternative 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds, quality + coverage
- **Cons**: More complex implementation
- **Effort**: 8-10 weeks

### Alternative 4: Crowd-sourced Pattern Collection
- **Pros**: Diverse real-world patterns, community involvement
- **Cons**: Quality control challenges, licensing issues
- **Effort**: 10-12 weeks (including community coordination)

- GitHub Actions environment for automated testing

## Estimated Effort
**8-10 weeks** including pattern curation, generation system, validation, and integration.

## Learning and Reflection Elements

### Self-Assessment Questions
During implementation, regularly reflect on:
1. **Pattern Quality**: Are automated generation strategies producing realistic and valuable test patterns?
2. **Complexity Correlation**: How well do theoretical complexity metrics correlate with actual rmatch performance characteristics?
3. **Coverage Effectiveness**: Are we discovering regex features or pattern types that reveal unexpected performance insights?
4. **Integration Success**: How smoothly does the pattern library integrate with the foundation infrastructure from Task 001?

### Progress Checkpoints
- **Week 3**: Pattern generation effectiveness assessment - is automation providing sufficient quality and coverage?
- **Week 6**: Performance characterization evaluation - do complexity metrics predict actual rmatch behavior?
- **Week 8**: Integration validation - is the pattern library working effectively with Task 001 infrastructure?

### Plan Adjustment Triggers
Be prepared to adjust subsequent task approaches if:
- Pattern generation quality is insufficient (may require more manual curation effort in subsequent tasks)
- Complexity metrics poorly correlate with actual performance (may affect metrics collection in Task 004)
- Specific pattern categories reveal critical performance bottlenecks (may prioritize algorithm development focus)
- Integration challenges emerge (may affect corpus selection strategy in Task 003)

### Learning Capture Requirements
Document for Task 002E evaluation and subsequent task refinement:
- Pattern generation quality assessment and improvement recommendations
- Correlation analysis between complexity metrics and actual rmatch performance
- Specific pattern categories that revealed optimization opportunities or algorithm stress points
- Integration effectiveness and lessons for corpus diversification (Task 003)

### Insights for Future Tasks
Capture insights that should inform:
- **Task 003 (Corpus Diversification)**: Which text domains should be prioritized based on pattern performance insights?
- **Task 004 (Metrics Collection)**: Which performance dimensions proved most critical for pattern analysis?
- **Task 005 (Automated Generation)**: How can automated generation be refined based on pattern effectiveness learnings?

**Note**: Completion of this task triggers Task 002E (Pattern Library Evaluation & Learning) to capture insights and refine subsequent task planning.

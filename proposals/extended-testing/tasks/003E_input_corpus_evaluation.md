- **Optimization Priority Identification**: Identify which domain characteristics suggest the most impactful optimization directions
- **Algorithmic Stress Point Analysis**: Evaluate which text types stress different aspects of rmatch algorithm implementation

### Bioinformatics Dataset Insights
- **Biological Sequence Performance**: Analyze rmatch behavior on DNA/RNA sequences, protein data, and gene annotations
- **Long Match Scenarios**: Evaluate performance on biological sequences with high repetition rates and long exact matches
- **Motif Pattern Analysis**: Test rmatch effectiveness on biological motifs and regulatory sequence patterns
- **Scalability Assessment**: Measure performance scalability across different biological dataset sizes

### Text Characteristic Impact Analysis
- **Character Set Effects**: Analyze performance impact of different character set diversities across domains
- **Structure Pattern Influence**: Evaluate how text structural patterns (line length, repetition, formatting) affect performance
- **Domain-Specific Patterns**: Identify characteristic patterns within each domain that reveal optimization opportunities
- **Synthetic vs. Real-World Comparison**: Compare synthetic stress test effectiveness vs. real-world corpus insights

### Benchmark Validation
